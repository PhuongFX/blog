In early this July I wanted to start an AI and chose HuggingFace Spaces as the framework to begin with. After looking through several collections of HF models , I decided to build one app by myself. Previously I have written UI for some personal projects from scratch, with little code being reused. Getting interested with taks in `Natural Language Processing` and `Audio` aspects, I planned to build an unified UI framework apply to all scenario. Through the development process I gradually recognized the important of auto-detection function of Language-Audio generation models, and finally I got an idea in my mind to which is a bit  different from other demos in HF, that is an app to help us detect somethings that audio said about, then conveniently it also translate them to help us understand [Audio_Transcribe_Translate](https://github.com/PhuongFX/Audio_Transcribe_Translate). Fortunately those intergrated models are still from now, and their application are on my HF Hub, [STT Translate & Transcribe](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PhuongPhan/Audio_Transcribe_Translate).


As a new-born project it will inevitably have problems and defects. The development will be a progressive process and continuous effort will be devoted to improve the quality and add new features. If you found a bug or have features request, please don't hesitate to raise an issue and let me know.
