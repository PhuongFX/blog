The goal of Antarctica is evolving to an elegant and feature-rich theme across platforms.

[Live demo](https://sdtelectronics.github.io/jekyll-theme-antarctica/)

## Highlights
* Fully responsive layout achieves best visual on different screens
* Flexible widgets provide extensible functionality
* Integrated [NerdFonts](www.nerdfonts.com) with 3000+ icons
* Automatic sitemap generation with [Jekyll Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
* Configuration-free search engine optimization with [Jekyll Seo Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
* Reduced JavaScript usage to accelerate loading. No external js file for main frame (Some widgets require external JavaScript).

## Installation
There are three ways to install:
* If you are hosting the site by yourself, you may prefer to [install as a gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme)
* If you are hosting the site on Github pages, you can [install as a remote theme](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)
* You can also fork the release branch of this repository

## Customization
Customizable options are under [_config.yml](_config.yml). Coments inside will help you to edit them.
