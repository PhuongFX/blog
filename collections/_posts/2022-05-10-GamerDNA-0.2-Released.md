Months after the Speech To Text & Translation on HF Spaces, the final release of GamerDNA! is finally arrived. This beta includes some minor changes in appearance, and some major functional enhancements:
* Supports audio files and live recording 📻
* Uses the OpenAI Whisper Base model for speech recognition 💬
* Displays transcribed text in the app 📝
* Allows you to copy and paste the transcribed text for further use 📋
* Translates the transcribed text into multiple languages using the Google Madlad model 🌎
* Further in-coming features 

I hope you will enjoy this new web app, and make use with it!
